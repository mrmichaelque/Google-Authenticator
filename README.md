# Google Sign-In Demo

This project demonstrates how to integrate Google Sign-In into a web application. It allows users to sign in with their Google accounts and redirects them to a success page upon successful authentication. It also provides a sign-out button with a message alert.

## Features

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to have the following:

- A Google account
- A Google Cloud Platform project with the OAuth 2.0 API enabled
- A client ID for your web application

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code.
2. Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` in the `index.html` file with your actual Google client ID.
3. Host the application on a server or run it locally on port 3000.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on the Google Sign-In button.
